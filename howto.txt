flat_canvas.js
--------------

Brief introduction
------------------------

Flat canvas is my first real attempt at creating a reusable javascript library. I created this library after not being able to find a simple javascript library to meet my goals. Even if there is a simple library out there that I was 'lazy' to find, I decided to create and improve this library. The main goal is to create a good useful library to be used by anyone and to improve my coding.

What does it do?
-----------------------

The library adds the functionality to rotate, draw an image using different colours and saving the changes as an image to a canvas.
